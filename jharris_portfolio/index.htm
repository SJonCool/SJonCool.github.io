<h3>What I learned in this class</h3>

  <p>In a world that moves ever faster, technology has become a big part of how we run our lives. As a designer, itâ€™s important to be able to connect with a wide variety of people across a vast range of advertising avenues.</p>
    <p>Although learning about design techniques is important, the value of truly outstanding code will be part of what shapes the future and allows us to see very many aspects about design.</p>
    <p>The journey to start understanding code is a journey to understand DHTML. How each associate with eachother, and how each work with eachother.</p>
