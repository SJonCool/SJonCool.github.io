            <h2>Mediterranean Tacos</h2>
            <p>Wrapped in a tortilla of your choice, grilled chicken, shrimp, or pork is served with cucumber, tomato, red onion, olives, and spinach or kale. Mixed with Tzatziki yogurt and drizzled in a signature flavorful sauce, this dish can also be made with pita bread, or “Gyro style.” Ask for extra jalapenos or gorgonzola cheese. With salsa and dip. <a href= "Recipe_1.htm">Go to recipe</a></p>

            <h2>House Flatbread</h2>
            <p>Our take on the Margherita pizza. We start with your choice of tomato or alfredo sauce (light or extra), add a variety of cheeses, and fresh basil leaves. We then add classic San Marzano tomatoes, then add fresh banana peppers. Topped with our special seasoning and drizzled in sauce of choice, red jalapenos can be added for an extra kick. Tomatoes can also be served sun-dried. <a href= "Recipe_2.htm">Go to recipe</a></p>

            <h2>Classic Chicken Alfredo</h2>
            <p>This is a classic dish but served as anything but that! You get a choice of fettuccini, angel hair, or rigatoni pasta, then add our creamy four cheese parmesan sauce. Chicken can be grilled, fried, or blackened, then mixed with classic Italian seasoning, with garlic and sage. Noodles can also be deep fried, for Chow Mein Alfredo. <a href= "Recipe_3.htm">Go to recipe</a></p>
