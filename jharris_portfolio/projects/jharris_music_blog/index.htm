    When they say, “live by the game,” I’m someone who has been steeped in the music biz. My first DJ gig was when I was 12 years old mixing “Weird Al” Yankovic with Disney songs on cassette tapes. Soon after that came heavy metal and hip-hop, and history was made!

    As with every palette, it starts small and grows from there. Beginning with parodies set me up for a wide variety of styles, and soon that expanded into beat matching. When I was in high school, I was in a local band, which is where I learned how to sing and play guitar. It was during these years that I discovered the magic of Pink Floyd and started developing my affinity for effects and remixes.

    After high school, I started working for the Street Team for a rip-hop band and started studying audio engineering. I almost got a gig as a live engineer, but the opportunity came at the wrong time, so I opted to stay in school. Already having years of DJ experience, I started playing at local parties and venues.

    Although, always more of a hobby, I started working on small projects to expand my assets and eventually started putting together custom mixes. By this point, I was working with a particular style of hip-hop, and I used that to expand into other areas.

    After years of working behind the decks, I started working with computer software, and my work became mainly about effects. Since then, I’ve worked on expanding my technical skills while researching new techniques and hardware. I started playing the harmonica, which landed me some back-up gigs, but nothing too substantial.

    These days I’m more focused on the overall design of my sound, so I know I’ll be returning once I have enough skill to do something spectacular. Going back to some of my earlier inspirations, the members of Pink Floyd studied architecture, which gave them great insight into structure. Always a fan of soundscapes, I’ve used my unique beat matching skills to combine dubstep with hard rock, and many more innovative sounds. I still have several theme albums built up simply by lyrics, and with a bit of “spin” (pun intended), they can all be used to make sounds that define music.

    Below is a list, in no particular order of my topmost influential albums. In the spirit of a great gig, the albums are written as a set to be enjoyed as one long show.
