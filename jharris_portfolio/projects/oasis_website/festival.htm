<p>This year, Oasis is pleased to announce that we’re sponsoring the Woolly Worm Festival in Banner Elk, NC. An annual event, the festival focuses on the folklore of the woolly worm’s ability to predict the weather. With worm races, music, and crafts, the festival is fun for all ages! Along with sponsorship, Oasis helped cultivate the soil that this year’s fine worms reside in, so it should be one wild race! Below are the beginning of a new promotion campaign, featuring a unique Poster, Flyer, and Ticket design. For an actual ticket, please contact the main site and secure yours today!</p><br>

   <p>This year, we decided to give the festival a new face with Wacky Worm Man. More of an icon than an actual person, Worm Man features the fun of loving worms on a “large” scale. The grounds are standard for the festival, but this year features the very first Ferris wheel at the event. Below the ground, the trails the worms make show amazing upcoming events.</p><br>

    <p>We kept our new tickets simple and fun! On one side is Worm Man welcoming you to the festival…. But there’s more! Follow his advice and go “Underground (turn the ticket over), and you’ll find your entry for the Worm Race. All you have to do is present your ticket at the booth for the event, and you’ll get a special worm stamp with your number and position.</p>
