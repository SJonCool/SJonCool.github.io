    <h2>Postcards</h2>
    <p>We got our start small, so we started small. These 3 postcards were directly mailed to our future customers to show people what we do. The simple designs were used as templates to give the customer an idea of how we can help you.</p>
        <p>The brand starts by thinking about the future of soil, as expressed by our unique blends of fertilizer. The first blend is curative, and the final blend can only be described as “magical.”</p>
        <p>Throught these unique blends, we get to the next part, which cultivates the land. All produce made from our brand has not only met expectations, but it’s been proven to affect the ground around it, which brings us to our most important aspect… the soil.</p>
        <p>Worm casting is a big part of soil cultivation, because with healthy worms comes healthy soil. With plenty of aeration, our soil is always fresh and helps grow the best product. Fun fact: our soil has even helped in prominent events, as displayed on our Festival page.
