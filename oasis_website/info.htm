    <h2>Product Informaion</h2>
    <p>
        The idea for Oasis started with a simple concept. In a sea of confusion, we wanted to be the beacon of hope when it came to gardening. The design was simple, but the applications are infinite. From the “seed” that grows, life is cultivated and brings light to an entire garden.
        To date, we offer 3 unique blends of fertilizer that are meant to perform different functions. Always expanding, we combine these fertilizers with more nutrients for an overall blend that can make gardens grow, from small scale to agricultural.
        Below is a chart that offers the benefits of our unique blends. Please feel free to review them and assess your needs, as we’re always looking for new combinations!
